Retail Sales Analytics Using SQL

This project analyzes 50,000+ retail transactions (2019–2022) to uncover revenue drivers, customer retention patterns, and growth dynamics. Advanced SQL techniques were used to generate business insights including month-over-month growth, year-over-year comparisons, customer segmentation, and revenue concentration analysis.

Bussiness questions solved through this project:
- What is the total revenue, total customers, and total products?
- How does revenue trend month-over-month and year-over-year?
- Which year and quarter generated the highest revenue?
- What percentage of revenue comes from repeat customers?
- How is revenue distributed across regions?
- Which product categories and sub-categories drive the most revenue?
- What percentage of revenue comes from top-performing products?
- How can customers be segmented using cumulative revenue (ABC segmentation)?

SQL concept applied:
- Aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG)
- GROUP BY & HAVING
- Window Functions (LAG, DENSE_RANK)
- CTEs
- Cross Join
- Cumulative Calculations
- MoM & YoY Growth Analysis
- Revenue Segmentation Logic
